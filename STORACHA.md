# Storacha IPFS Setup and AES-256 Proof Encryption

This guide explains how to set up IPFS uploads via Storacha for the dApp, how to generate and encrypt your Storacha proof with AES-256, and how to configure the required environment variables.

The dApp server route `dapp/src/pages/api/w3up-delegation.js` expects:
- `STORACHA_SING_PRIVATE_KEY` (required): your Storacha ED25519 principal private key.

If `STORACHA_PROOF` is exactly 64 characters, the app treats it as an AES key (hex) and decrypts a local `encrypted_proof.bin` using `dapp/src/utils/decryptAES256.ts`.

## 1) Create a Storacha Proof

Follow Storacha docs to create a Space and obtain its Proof (a UCAN proof string). You will end up with a proof string you can paste into an environment variable or encrypt locally.

Install CLI:

```bash
bun install -g @storacha/cli
```

Create a space:

```bash
w3 space create
```
You will be prompted to enter a name for your space:

```
What would you like to call this space? <enter name>
```

The CLI will then output something like:

```
You need to save the following secret recovery key somewhere safe!
For example write it down on a piece of paper and put it inside your favorite book.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

This will generate a UCAN proof string (in `proof.txt`) that you can:

* Paste directly into an environment variable (**plain mode**), or
* Encrypt into `encrypted_proof.bin` (**encrypted mode**, recommended).

Keep this string safe; it grants the app permission to delegate for uploads.

---

## 2) Choose Your Storage Mode for the Proof

You have two supported options.

- Plain mode (simplest): store the proof directly in the `STORACHA_PROOF` environment variable.
- Encrypted mode (recommended): encrypt the proof locally into `encrypted_proof.bin` and store only the AES key (hex) in the environment.

> Why encrypted mode?
> Some hosting providers (like **Netlify**) impose strict limits on environment variable size.
> Since proofs can be large, we use AES encryption to store them in a file (`encrypted_proof.bin`) and only keep the short AES key in `STORACHA_PROOF`.

The runtime logic in `w3up-delegation.js`:
- If `STORACHA_PROOF.length === 64` ‚Üí treat it as AES key hex and decrypt `encrypted_proof.bin` at runtime.
- Otherwise, treat `STORACHA_PROOF` as the plain proof string.

---
## 3) Encrypted Mode: Generate AES Key and `encrypted_proof.bin`

The repository provides [`tools/AES256-encrypt.js`](../tools/AES256-encrypt.js), which encrypts your proof with **AES-GCM** and writes an `encrypted_proof.bin` file.

Run it with your proof as an argument:

```bash
node tools/AES256-encrypt.js "<PASTE_YOUR_STORACHA_PROOF_STRING>"
```

The script will output something like:

```
This is our key in hex: <64-hex-key>
Encrypted data written to encrypted_proof.bin
```

* Copy the 64-hex key and keep it safe.
* Move the generated file into the dApp root so the server can find it at runtime:

```bash
mv encrypted_proof.bin dapp/
```

### Notes:

* The decryption helper [`decryptAES256.ts`](../dapp/src/utils/decryptAES256.ts) expects the same header (`storachaProof`).
  If you change the header in the encryption script, you must also update it in the decryption code.
* You **may commit** `encrypted_proof.bin` if needed to reproduce builds.
  But never commit your AES key or `.env` file.

## 4) Configure Environment Variables

Create your dApp environment file from the template and populate required values:

```bash
cp dapp/.env.example dapp/.env
```

Open `dapp/.env` and set:

- `STORACHA_SING_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your storacha principal private key.
- `STORACHA_PROOF`:
  - Encrypted mode: set this to the 64-hex key printed by the encryption script. Ensure `dapp/encrypted_proof.bin` exists.
  - Plain mode: set this to the entire proof string.

Example (`dapp/.env`):

```dotenv
# ... other PUBLIC_ variables omitted for brevity
STORACHA_SING_PRIVATE_KEY="<YOUR_ED25519_PRIVATE_KEY>"
# Encrypted mode: 64-hex key from the encryption step; requires dapp/encrypted_proof.bin
STORACHA_PROOF="<64-HEX-AES-KEY>"
```

If you prefer plain mode:

```dotenv
STORACHA_SING_PRIVATE_KEY="<YOUR_ED25519_PRIVATE_KEY>"
STORACHA_PROOF="<YOUR_PLAIN_STORACHA_PROOF_STRING>"
```

---

## 5) Verify Your Setup

- Development server:
  ```bash
  cd dapp
  bun install
  bun run dev
  ```

- Trigger the delegation API in the app flow that requests delegation (proposal/member/project). The server route `POST /src/pages/api/w3up-delegation.js` will:
  - Validate inputs and environment.
  - If `STORACHA_PROOF` is 64 hex, call `decryptAES256` to read `encrypted_proof.bin` and decrypt your proof.
  - Initialize a storacha client and return a delegation archive.

If misconfigured, you may see:
- `Storacha credentials not configured. Please set STORACHA_SING_PRIVATE_KEY and STORACHA_PROOF` (missing env vars)
- Decryption errors (mismatched key/header or missing `dapp/encrypted_proof.bin`).

# Storacha IPFS Setup and AES-256 Proof Encryption

This guide explains how to set up IPFS uploads via Storacha for the dApp, how to generate and encrypt your Storacha
proof with AES-256, and how to configure the required environment variables.

The dApp server route `dapp/src/pages/api/w3up-delegation.js` expects:

- `STORACHA_SING_PRIVATE_KEY`: your Storacha ED25519 principal private key.
- `STORACHA_PROOF`: a delegation proof to allow upload to Storacha.

If `STORACHA_PROOF` is exactly 64 characters, the app treats it as an AES key and decrypts a local
`encrypted_proof.bin` using `dapp/src/utils/decryptAES256.ts`.

## 1) Create a Storacha Key and Proof

Follow Storacha's documentation to create a Space and obtain its Proof (a UCAN proof string). You will end up with a
proof string you can paste into an environment variable or encrypt locally.

If you do not have an account, you will be prompted to create one and select a plan. The free plan is more than enough
for what we want to do.

Install the CLI:

```bash
bun install @storacha/cli
```

Create a space:

```bash
storacha login
storacha space create tansu
```

This will generate a space which is identifiable by a DID, something like `did:key:z6Mk...`.

The next step is to create a key, this is `STORACHA_SING_PRIVATE_KEY`:

```bash
storacha key create --json
```

Next up, we create a delegation proof:

```bash
export AUDIENCE=did:key:z6Mk...
storacha delegation create $AUDIENCE -c space/blob/add -c space/index/add -c filecoin/offer -c upload/add --base64
```

## 2) Choose Your Storage Mode for the Proof

You have two supported options.

- Plain mode: store the proof directly in the `STORACHA_PROOF` environment variable.
- Encrypted mode: encrypt the proof locally into `encrypted_proof.bin` and store only the AES key (hex) in
  the environment.

> Some hosting providers (like **Netlify**) impose strict limits on environment variable size.
> Since proofs can be large, we use AES encryption to store them in a file (`encrypted_proof.bin`) and only keep the
> short AES key in `STORACHA_PROOF`.

The runtime logic in `w3up-delegation.js`:

- If `STORACHA_PROOF.length === 64` â†’ treat it as AES key hex and decrypt `encrypted_proof.bin` at runtime.
- Otherwise, treat `STORACHA_PROOF` as the plain proof string.

---

## 3) Encrypted Mode: Generate an AES Key and `encrypted_proof.bin`

[`tools/AES256-encrypt.js`](../tools/AES256-encrypt.js) encrypts the proof with *
*AES-GCM** and writes an `encrypted_proof.bin` file.

```bash
node tools/AES256-encrypt.js "<STORACHA_PROOF>"
```

### Notes:

* The decryption helper [`decryptAES256.ts`](../dapp/src/utils/decryptAES256.ts) expects the same header (
  `storachaProof`).
  If you change the header in the encryption script, you must also update it in the decryption code.
* You **may commit** `encrypted_proof.bin` if needed to reproduce builds.
  But never commit your AES key or `.env` file.

---

## 4) Configure Environment Variables

Create your dApp environment file from the template and populate required values:

```bash
cp dapp/.env.example dapp/.env
```

Open `dapp/.env` and set:

- `STORACHA_SING_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your storacha principal private key.
- `STORACHA_PROOF`:
    - Encrypted mode: set this to the 64-hex key printed by the encryption script. Ensure `dapp/encrypted_proof.bin`
      exists.
    - Plain mode: set this to the entire proof string.

Example (`dapp/.env`):

```dotenv
# ... other PUBLIC_ variables omitted for brevity
STORACHA_SING_PRIVATE_KEY="<YOUR_ED25519_PRIVATE_KEY>"
# Encrypted mode: 64-hex key from the encryption step; requires dapp/encrypted_proof.bin
STORACHA_PROOF="<64-HEX-AES-KEY>"
```

If you prefer plain mode:

```dotenv
STORACHA_SING_PRIVATE_KEY="<YOUR_ED25519_PRIVATE_KEY>"
STORACHA_PROOF="<YOUR_PLAIN_STORACHA_PROOF_STRING>"
```

---

## 5) Verify Your Setup

- Development server:
  ```bash
  cd dapp
  bun install
  bun run dev
  ```

- Trigger the delegation API in the app flow that requests delegation (proposal/member/project). The server route
  `POST /src/pages/api/w3up-delegation.js` will:
    - Validate inputs and environment.
    - If `STORACHA_PROOF` is 64 hex, call `decryptAES256` to read `encrypted_proof.bin` and decrypt your proof.
    - Initialize a storacha client and return a delegation archive.

If misconfigured, you may see:

- `Storacha credentials not configured. Please set STORACHA_SING_PRIVATE_KEY and STORACHA_PROOF` (missing env vars)
- Decryption errors (mismatched key/header or missing `dapp/encrypted_proof.bin`).

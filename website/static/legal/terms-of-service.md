# Terms of Service - Tansu

**Last Updated: October 21, 2025**  
**Effective: October 21, 2025**  

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Tansu ("the dApp"), a decentralized governance platform operated by Consulting Manao GmbH ("Company", "we", "us"), located at Köpplingberg 124, 8561 Söding-Sankt Johann, Austria (Company Registration: FN 571029z). By accessing or using the dApp, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the dApp.

Tansu is a decentralized application built on the Stellar blockchain that provides on-chain project governance, community voting, and transparent decision-making for open-source projects.

**Please Note**: We recommend reading our Privacy Policy alongside these Terms to understand how your data is processed. Our architecture is fully decentralized—we do not operate backend servers or store user data.

## 2. Definitions

To help you understand these Terms, we've defined key terms used throughout this document:

**Badge**: A role-based token that determines voting weight and permissions within projects.

**CID (Content Identifier)**: A unique identifier for content stored on IPFS, ensuring immutability and verification.

**Commitment**: A cryptographic commitment used in anonymous voting to hide vote choices until execution.

**IPFS**: InterPlanetary File System, a decentralized storage protocol used for storing proposal content, profiles, and project metadata.

**Maintainer**: An authorized user who can manage project settings, update commit hashes, and execute proposals.

**Member**: A registered user of the Tansu platform with associated profile and voting capabilities.

**Project**: An on-chain registered open-source project with associated governance, metadata, and maintainers.

**Project Key**: A unique identifier derived from the project name, used to reference projects on-chain.

**Proposal**: A governance proposal submitted by community members for voting and potential execution.

**Public Vote**: A transparent voting mechanism where vote choices are visible on-chain.

**Anonymous Vote**: A privacy-preserving voting mechanism using BLS12-381 cryptography to hide individual vote choices.

**Smart Contract**: Self-executing contracts deployed on the Stellar blockchain that govern platform operations.

**Soroban Domains**: A naming service on Stellar that prevents project name squatting and ensures authenticity.

**Stellar Network**: The decentralized blockchain network on which Tansu operates.

**Voting Weight**: The influence a member has in governance decisions, determined by their assigned badges.

**Wallet**: A third-party application that manages Stellar accounts and private keys.

## 3. Eligibility and Account Requirements

To use Tansu's services, you must meet the following requirements:

**Age**: You must be at least 18 years old to use our services.

**Restricted Jurisdictions**: You may not use our services if you reside in or are subject to the laws of FATF (Financial Action Task Force) high-risk or non-cooperative jurisdictions, or if you are subject to sanctions imposed by the United Nations, European Union, or Austria. Current FATF lists are available at fatf-gafi.org. You are also prohibited if using our services is illegal in your country.

**Stellar Wallet**: You must use a third-party Stellar wallet to authenticate your Stellar Account. Tansu does not provide wallet services, and you are responsible for securing your wallet and private keys.

**Member Registration**: You must register as a member to participate in governance activities. Registration requires providing accurate information and may include profile data stored on IPFS.

## 4. Services Description

Tansu provides a comprehensive governance platform with the following core functionalities:

**Project Registration**: On-chain project tracking with domain integration, commit hash verification, and maintainer management. Note: Project registration fees are handled by Soroban Domains, not Tansu.

**Membership System**: Community registration with badge-based roles, voting weight assignment, and profile management.

**Governance (DAO)**: Proposal creation, public and anonymous voting mechanisms, and proposal execution with transparent outcomes.

**IPFS Integration**: Decentralized storage for proposals, member profiles, project metadata, and other content with immutable addressing.

**Anonymous Voting**: BLS12-381 cryptographic commitment schemes with ECDH key management for privacy-preserving governance.

**Donations**: XLM transfer functionality allowing users to donate to projects.

**Collateral System**: Fixed amount set by Tansu in smart contracts, required for proposal creation and voting. Collateral is reimbursed to proposers and voters when proposals are successfully executed.

**Free Service**: Tansu is provided free of charge. Users are only responsible for blockchain transaction fees (gas fees) paid directly to the Stellar Network.

## 5. User Responsibilities

**Lawful Use**: Use services in compliance with Austrian law, your country's laws, and these Terms.

**Wallet Security**: You are responsible for securing your wallet and private keys. We are not liable for compromised wallets or lost keys.

**Accurate Information**: Provide accurate information when using our services.

**Content Compliance**: You are solely responsible for all content you upload. See Section 7 for detailed obligations.

**Role-Specific Responsibilities**:
- **Anonymous Voters**: See Section 6 for key management requirements
- **Project Maintainers**: See Section 8.2 for moderation and revocation duties

## 6. Blockchain Technology and Anonymous Voting Risks

You acknowledge and accept the following risks:

**Transaction Irreversibility**: Blockchain transactions are permanent and cannot be reversed.

**Cryptocurrency Volatility**: XLM prices fluctuate significantly.

**Network Dependencies**: Services rely on Stellar Network, IPFS, Soroban Domains, and other third-party services beyond our control.

**Smart Contract Risks**: Contracts may contain bugs or unexpected behavior.

**Fork Risk**: We follow the canonical Stellar blockchain as determined by the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF).

**Anonymous Voting Risks**:
- ECDH key pairs generated client-side using Web Crypto API
- You must securely download and store private keys before voting
- Lost keys prevent vote decryption and proposal execution
- No recovery mechanism exists

**No Recourse**: Lost keys, failed transactions, or errors cannot be reversed or compensated.

## 7. IPFS Content Storage and Moderation

### 7.1 Infrastructure Provider Role

**Our Role**: We provide infrastructure services for decentralized content storage using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). We are not a content host, publisher, or content service provider under the Digital Services Act (DSA).

**Content Permanence**: IPFS is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network where content is distributed across multiple nodes. Once content is uploaded to IPFS:
- It receives a unique Content Identifier (CID)
- It may be cached and replicated across the network
- It persists independently of our platform
- It cannot be deleted from the IPFS network

### 7.2 Content Moderation Limitations

**Limited Moderation Capabilities**: As an infrastructure provider, we have limited ability to moderate content on IPFS. We can only unlink content references from our smart contracts - content remains accessible via its CID even after unlinking.

**On-Chain Unlinking**: When we remove content references from our smart contracts, the content is no longer displayed in our dApp interface but remains on IPFS and accessible via direct CID.

**Reporting Mechanisms**: Users can report inappropriate content by contacting legal@consulting-manao.com. Removal is limited to unlinking from our platform.

### 7.3 Content Liability

**User Responsibility**: You are solely liable for all content you upload, including legal compliance, intellectual property rights, accuracy, and appropriateness.

**Platform Immunity**: We are not liable for user-generated content stored on IPFS, except where required by applicable law.

**Maintainer Authority**: Project maintainers have authority to moderate content within their projects and may request content unlinking from our platform.

## 8. Proposal System and Revocation Mechanisms

### 8.1 Proposal Submission and Collateral

**Collateral Requirement**: Proposals require collateral in XLM to prevent spam and ensure serious submissions. The collateral amount is fixed and set by Tansu in the smart contract.

**Voting Collateral**: Voters must also provide collateral to participate in voting, ensuring commitment to the governance process.

**Collateral Reimbursement**: Collateral is reimbursed to proposers and voters when proposals are successfully executed.

**Collateral Forfeiture**: Collateral may be forfeited if:
- The proposal is revoked by the maintainer
- The proposal violates these Terms
- The proposal contains illegal or inappropriate content
- The proposal is found to be fraudulent or deceptive
- The proposal fails to execute due to technical issues

**Non-Refundable Deterrent Deposit**: Collateral serves as a deterrent against malicious proposals and is generally non-refundable except upon successful execution.

### 8.2 Maintainer Authority and Revocation

**Revocation Rights**: Project maintainers have the authority to revoke proposals within their projects.

**Revocation Grounds**: Maintainers may revoke proposals for:
- Terms violations or prohibited activities
- Inappropriate or illegal content
- Technical issues or errors
- Disputes or conflicts
- Any reason at their discretion

**Revocation Process**:
1. Maintainer initiates revocation through the dApp interface
2. Collateral is forfeited to the maintainer
3. Proposal is marked as revoked
4. Voting is terminated
5. Proposal cannot be re-submitted

**Revocation Effect**: Revoked proposals:
- Are removed from active voting
- Cannot be executed
- Result in collateral forfeiture
- Are marked in the proposal history

**Appeals**: Revocation decisions are final and cannot be appealed through our platform.

### 8.3 Soroban Domains Escalation

**Domain Disputes**: For projects using Soroban Domains, disputes may be escalated to the Soroban Domains system.

**Domain Authority**: Soroban Domains maintainers have ultimate authority over domain-related decisions.

**Platform Compliance**: We will comply with Soroban Domains decisions regarding domain ownership and usage.

**Registration Fees**: Project registration fees and related costs are handled by Soroban Domains, not Tansu. We are not responsible for Soroban Domains' fee structure or payment processing.

## 9. Intellectual Property

**License Grant**: By uploading content, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to:

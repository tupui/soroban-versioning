# Privacy Policy - Tansu

**Last Updated: October 21, 2025**  
**Effective: October 21, 2025**

## 1. Introduction

Consulting Manao GmbH ("Company", "we", "us") operates the Tansu decentralized governance platform ("dApp", "Service"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how we collect, use, and protect your personal data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Austrian data protection laws.

**Universal Application**: This Privacy Policy applies equally to all users worldwide, with no distinction between EU and non-EU residents, though we distinguish between consumers and business users where necessary for legal compliance.

**Minimal Data Collection**: Our services involve minimal personal data collection. We do not operate backend servers or databases. All user data is stored on-chain (Stellar blockchain) or on decentralized IPFS networks. We use browser local storage instead of cookies for session management.

## 15. Data Protection Officer

As a small GmbH, we are not required to appoint a Data Protection Officer under GDPR Article 37, but privacy inquiries can be directed to legal@consulting-manao.com.

**Why No DPO Required**: Under GDPR Article 37(1), DPO appointment is mandatory only for:
- Public authorities
- Organizations whose core activities consist of processing operations requiring regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale
- Organizations whose core activities consist of processing on a large scale of special categories of data

Our dApp operates with minimal data collection, no backend storage, and all sensitive operations occur client-side or on public blockchains, thus not meeting these thresholds.

You have the right to lodge a complaint with the Austrian Data Protection Authority:

**Austrian Data Protection Authority**  
Barichgasse 40-42

# Quick-Start

The web interface at [https://testnet.tansu.dev](https://testnet.tansu.dev) is the easiest way to interact with Tansu. All contract calls use the [Stellar Wallets Kit](https://github.com/stellar/js-wallets-kit) for non-custodial wallet integration.

> The steps below assume you are connected to **Testnet**. For Mainnet the flow is identical – only network selection and contract ID will differ.

## 1. Connect your wallet

1. Click **Connect** at the top-right corner.
2. Select your preferred wallet (Freighter, Albedo, …).
3. Authorise the connection – your public key now appears in the header.
4. Join the community – fill out details about yourself.

## 2. Register a project

1. Go to **Projects ▶ Register**.
2. Fill in:

- **Name** – 15 characters max (must be available as a Soroban Domain)
- **Maintainers** – comma-separated list of Stellar addresses
- **Metadata** – The rest is metadata such as the link to the code repository.

3. Press **Register** and sign the transaction.

The dApp shows a **pending** status until the transaction is confirmed. Once done the new project appears on the dashboard.

## 3. Update your commit hash

Inside a project page click **Set commit hash**, paste the 40-character Git commit SHA and sign. The commit is stored on-chain and displayed alongside a link to the corresponding GitHub commit.

For an automated workflow, install the pre-push hook described in the [Git Hooks](developers/on_chain.mdx#git-hooks) section.

## 4. Manage maintainers & badges

- **Add Member** – registers a contributor on-chain so they can receive badges.
- **Add Badge** – maintainers can grant `Developer`, `Triage`, `Community`, `Verified` or `Default` badges to any member.

See the [Membership](developers/membership.mdx) page for details.

## 5. Create a proposal

1. Go to the **Governance** tab inside a project.
2. Press **New proposal**.
3. Fill in:

- **Title**
- **Description** – rich-text editor (stored on IPFS)
- **Voting end** – calendar picker (1-30 days)
- **Outcome Contract** – external contract address for callbacks (optional)

4. Submit and sign.

The proposal immediately appears with status **Active**.

## 6. Vote

While a proposal is **Active** press **Vote** and choose **Approve**, **Reject** or **Abstain**. The dApp automatically selects the correct call (public or anonymous) based on the proposal settings.

## 7. Execute

After the voting window closes any maintainer can press **Execute**. If the proposal includes an outcome contract, the appropriate callback is triggered based on the result (Approved, Rejected, or Cancelled).

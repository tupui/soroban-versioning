# Membership & Badges

The smart-contract powering Tansu keeps track of community members **on-chain** and assigns them _badges_. These badges are more than simple labels – they carry a **numerical weight** that is later used for weighted voting inside a project's DAO.

## Registering as a member

Anyone can register themselves on-chain by calling:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --source-account G... \
  --network testnet \
  --id <TANSU_CONTRACT_ID> \
  -- \
  add_member \
  --member_address G... \
  --meta <ipfs_cid>
```

`meta` is optional. When supplied it must be an **IPFS CID** pointing to a folder that contains:

- `profile.json` – free-form JSON metadata (name, description, …)
- `profile-image.png` – avatar (optional)

The dApp will automatically render this information in the **Member profile** modal.

## Badges

Maintainers can assign one or several badges to a member for a given project. Badges are stored on-chain and influence the maximum weight a member's vote can carry.

| Badge | Weight | Typical use-case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Developer | 10 000 000 | Core code contributors |
| Triage | 5 000 000 | Issue triage & review |
| Community | 1 000 000 | Active community member |
| Verified | 500 000 | Owns a [Soroban Domain](https://sorobandomains.org/) |
| Default | 1 | Anyone else |

> The weight column reflects the numeric values found in the `Badge` enum of the contract (see source code). When several badges are present their weights are **summed** to obtain the member's total voting power.

### Adding badges

Only maintainers of a project can add badges:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --source-account <MAINTAINER_G...> \
  --network testnet \
  --id <TANSU_CONTRACT_ID> \
  -- \
  set_badges \
  --maintainer <MAINTAINER_G...> \
  --key <project_key> \
  --member <member_G...> \
  --badges '[Developer,Community]'
```

The dApp exposes a convenient **"Add badge"** modal that wraps this call.

## Query helpers

Smart-contract helpers make it easy to retrieve information:

- `get_member` → full `Member` structure (projects + badges + meta)
- `get_badges` → badge holders for a project
- `get_max_weight` → compute effective voting weight for an address

These endpoints are all used by the dApp and are public – anyone can call them from an RPC or another contract.

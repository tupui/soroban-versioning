# Tansu information file

Metadata on the projects are defined in a TOML file using the [SEP-1](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0001.md) specification-which standardize the Stellar Info File. This file is to be named `tansu.toml` as to avoid the confusion and collision with `stellar.toml`.

- `DOCUMENTATION`: information about the project
- `ACCOUNTS`: public keys of the maintainers
- `PRINCIPALS`: information about maintainers. At least the GitHub handle should be present.

## Project Name vs Domain Name

When registering a project, you specify two names:

1. **Soroban Domain name** (e.g., `myproject`): The on-chain identifier limited to 15 lowercase letters, registered on [Soroban Domains](https://sorobandomains.org/).

2. **Project Name** (`PROJECT_NAME` in tansu.toml): The human-readable display name shown in the UI. This is a required field and can be different from your domain name.

This separation is useful for:
- Organizations that want a more descriptive project name
- Projects with names longer than 15 characters
- Supporting multiple projects under the same organization domain

:::note[Order matters]

The order of both `ACCOUNTS` and `PRINCIPALS` is important as to link a maintainer with its public key.

Bellow is a complete example of a project information file:

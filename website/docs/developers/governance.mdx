# Governance & Proposals

Each project registered on Tansu automatically gets its own **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** smart-contract state. This DAO enables maintainers and community members to discuss, vote and execute actions in an auditable, on-chain way.

## Proposal lifecycle

Below is a mermaid diagram illustrating the proposal lifecycle:

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A[Create Proposal] --> B[Active];
    B -->|Vote period elapsed| C{Execute};
    C -->|Public Voting| D[Direct Tally];
    C -->|Anonymous Voting| E[Upload Tallies & Seeds];
    D --> F[Approved/Rejected/Cancelled];
    E --> G[Verify Commitments];
    G --> H[Approved/Rejected/Cancelled];
    F -->|If Approved| I[(Execute XDR Action)];
    H -->|If Approved| I;
```

1. **create_proposal** – a maintainer submits a new proposal (title, ipfs, voting_ends_at, public_voting).
2. **Active** – during the voting window members cast weighted votes (approve, reject, abstain).
3. **Tallies** – once voting ends, a maintainer can tally (using execute) – if anonymous, tallies & seeds are supplied.
4. The proposal status becomes **Approved**, **Rejected** or **Cancelled** (see `_types.ProposalStatus_`).
5. In case of **Approved**, a follow‑up XDR transaction (embedded in the proposal) is submitted automatically.

## Public vs. Anonymous voting

Anonymous voting in Tansu uses a cryptographic commitment scheme (BLS12-381) to keep individual votes private until tallying. This is ideal for sensitive decisions or when you want to reduce social pressure and bias.

| Mode | Call | On-chain storage | Who can see the vote? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public | `vote(PublicVote)` | Full vote payload | Everyone, instantly |
| Anonymous | `vote(AnonymousVote)` | 3 BLS-12-381 commitments | Nobody (until execute) |

Anonymous voting requires a one-time configuration (`anonymous_voting_setup`). The contract stores two generator points and the ECDH public key used to encrypt voters' seeds.

The helper `build_commitments_from_votes` can be called in simulation to reproduce the exact commitments client-side.

- Each vote is committed as:  
  $C = G(v) \cdot H(r)$ where `G`, `H` are generator points, `v` is the vote, and `r` is a random seed.
- Only commitments are stored on-chain. The actual votes and seeds are encrypted off-chain and revealed at tally time.
- At tally, the contract checks that the sum of commitments matches the commitments derived from the revealed tallies and seeds.

### Workflow

1. **Setup**: maintainers calls `anonymous_voting_setup` to share a public key.
2. **Proposal**: Maintainer creates an anonymous proposal with `public_voting: false`.
3. **Voting**: Members generate commitments and encrypted payloads off-chain, then submit `AnonymousVote` via the contract.
4. **Tally**: After voting ends, encrypted votes and seeds are decrypted off-chain, summed, and submitted to the contract for verification and execution.

## Weights & quorum

The effective weight of a vote is given by [`get_max_weight`](./membership.mdx). The contract does **not** impose a fixed quorum rule – instead it considers the weighted tallies:

- `approve > (abstain + reject)` → **Approved**
- `reject > (abstain + approve)` → **Rejected**
- Otherwise → **Cancelled** (including when approve = reject)

Custom quorum logic (percentage, thresholds…) can be built off-chain before deciding whether to call `execute`.

## Pagination helpers

DAO state is paginated to keep storage small and predictable:

- `get_dao(project_key, page)` – returns up to **9** proposals
- `get_proposal(project_key, proposal_id)` – fetch a single proposal by id

`MAX_PAGES` is 1000, meaning a project can store up to **9000 proposals** on-chain.

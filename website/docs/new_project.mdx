# Register a new project

The first step into Tansu is to generate your project. After doing a search in the search bar, you will be prompted to register your project. Only 15 characters are allowed. Registering a project will register a domain with the same name on [Soroban Domain](https://sorobandomains.org/) if the maintainer making the registration does not already own the domain.

:::warning[Domains]

Only register projects you are a maintainer of and are allowed to register. The domains are protected by the collateral system from Soroban Domains. Misuse and impersonation will be reported and result in the loss of the collateral.

#### Domain ownership changes

If the Soroban domain is transferred after project registration, you **must** submit a maintainer update in Tansu before any further governance activity. Failing to do so can invalidate proposal execution because domain ownership and on-chain maintainers diverge.

:::

When registering a project, a `Tansu information file` is created for you in the background. This `tansu.toml` which is hosted on IPFS and holds metadata for your project. The dApp is using the data to make a nice project card.

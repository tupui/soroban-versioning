# Welcome to Tansu!

Tansu is a novel way to manage open source projects. Open source development is hard:

- supply Chain Security concerns,
- lack of transparency,
- unfair retribution to participants,
- non-working governance due to the heavy reliance of mailing lists and forums,
- centralized platforms (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

It all comes down to centralization and obfuscation. Developing your project with Tansu means adopting a decentralized first approach, effectively addressing all these problems.

## Difference with GitHub

Tansu does not replace GitHub, or your preferred hosting solution, rather it complements it. GitHub is great at hosting, sharing code and making change requests. What Tansu brings is a set of tools to manage and govern your project.

## Open Governance

Projects on Tansu get their very own Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The community of a project is able to vote on new features, propose organizational changes or even trigger complex actions such as making a release or adding a new maintainer to a project.

The project have a wallet and their DAO is used to control the funds' allocation. There are mainly two pools. The first pool is dedicated to developers. Funds are automatically distributed to active maintainers based on specific criteria. The rest of the funds is managed by the DAO for other purposes such as compensating non-developers, infrastructure costs, or even organizing events.

## Security

Tansu adds an extra layer of security. It proposes a solution to track code changes on-chain and enable anyone to verify that the code hosted on GitHub is indeed the same. Coupled with other best practices, such as, reproducible build, code signing and attestation of provenance, Tansu guarantees that the code history has not been tampered with.

## Still building

Tansu is still in early development. Things change fast and new features are added as we play with the protocol and get feedback from the community.

Tansu is fully Open-Source, so join us on [GitHub](https://github.com/tupui/soroban-versioning) and let's build together!

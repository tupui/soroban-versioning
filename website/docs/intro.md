# Welcome to Tansu!

Tansu is a governance and versioning layer for open source projects, built on the Stellar blockchain. It brings transparency, security, and decentralized decision-making to software development by combining on-chain project tracking, a powerful DAO, and a flexible badge-based membership system.

## What is Tansu?

Tansu complements platforms like GitHub by providing:

- **On-chain project registration**: Projects are registered and tracked on Stellar, with commit hashes and metadata verifiable by anyone.
- **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**: Every project gets its own DAO, enabling maintainers and contributors to propose, vote, and execute decisions transparently.
- **Badge-based membership**: Roles and voting power are managed through on-chain badges, reflecting real project contributions.
- **Integration with Soroban Domains**: Project names are protected and mapped to Soroban Domains, preventing squatting and ensuring authenticity.
- **Open, auditable governance**: All actions—adding maintainers, updating metadata, voting—are recorded on-chain.

## Distinction with GitHub

Tansu does not replace GitHub (or your preferred hosting solution) – it complements it. While GitHub excels at hosting, sharing code, and managing change requests, Tansu brings on-chain governance, versioning, and decentralized decision-making. In other words, Tansu adds a transparent, auditable layer for project governance and commit verification, so you can build with confidence on open source.

## Key Features

- **Project versioning**: Track and verify the latest commit hash for any project, with links to the canonical code repository.
- **DAO proposals**: Submit, discuss, and vote on proposals (public or anonymous voting), with weighted votes based on badges.
- **Membership & badges**: Register as a member, earn badges for your contributions, and participate in governance.
- **Automated workflows**: Use Git hooks to sync commit hashes on-chain, and let the dApp handle signatures and wallet integration.

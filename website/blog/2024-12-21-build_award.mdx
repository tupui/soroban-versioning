We got it! Tansu received a Stellar Community Fund build Award!

You can read up the official announcement [here](https://medium.com/stellar-community/scf-30-round-recap-3da4be482add).

See the [post](2024-09-22-build_submission.mdx) I made for our submission for more details. We are more than on track for the MVP phase and even added some extra features such as IPFS support for the proposals.

A quick update 😃 The project is progressing very well and the contract is on testnet!

<!-- truncate -->

## Contract

The new address is https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CAP52ERGUZ65UNPHP36CQBHYUPEUG2TT4NPVEV7CREWRT7UCPD7PRWEE if you want to have a look.

## Register a new project

- Automatically check for an existing Soroban Domain (was actually not part of the deliverable but I thought it was necessary 🤘) and create one with the project name. Still figuring things out, but I think that it is a fairly good anti-abuse measure as people need to put collateral for a domain to register a project on Tansu.
- Push a new hash
- Get hash
- All these trigger events

## Backend

- Pre-commit hook machinery working. I am actually using it everytime I push. This allows us to monitor things like fees and general behaviour of the system. Get a feel for it.
- Event handling: DB setup and event ingestion, consumption and listeners parts are there.
- Small Python library for event handling helpers, tansu on PyPi.

## Next up

- POC of dApp is on the way (hopefully I can share news next week).
- Backend FastAPI for events and CRUD endpoints for the dApp
- Deploy the DB (we have a domain name, but nothing to show yet. Remember, design is my passion 😅 )
- Work on the config file
- Lot of small things, and cool stuff like continuous deployment for the contract (already there for the Python part.) Oh and I participated in the effort to improve the online doc of Soroban. Thanks to the knowledge I am getting while building this project, I was able to make 2 contributions (events and SAC testing). Maybe another one incoming.

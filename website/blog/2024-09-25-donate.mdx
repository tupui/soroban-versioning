Tansu got a new button, and it's a `Support` one! Funding open source software has always been a point of contention. Adding this simple support mechanism is just a glimpse into what Tansu will offer to project maintainers automagically.

But wait, there is one major difference compared to the seemingly same "support button" from GitHub or other like buy-me-a-coffee services. It's on-chain and funds goe straight to projects.

When you register your project on Tansu, the first thing that happens is that it registers a "Soroban Domains" for you-if you don't already have one for this address. With a domain, projects get their own Stellar address which can be used for many things. In this case, it's receiving funds.

Funding becomes fully transparent, practically costless, borderless and smarter thanks to smart contracts.

There is more! Because the project and it's account are on-chain, this button is the opening letter towards having a real transparent and fairer fund management on the project level and this is what we set ourselves to build with the next SCF Build program. Yes, Decentralized Autonomous Organization is coming.
